## Scope and Sequence

| Unit | Overview |
| :--- | :--- |
| [**1: Welcome**](units/unit1.md) | In this unit, coders will get to know their company, their instructors and their classmates.    Coders will review important routines, procedures and documents. Coders will complete a beginning of year challenge to review HTML, CSS, and Javascript from the Foundations course. |
| [**2: FanPage**](units/unit2.md) | In this unit, coders will build a fan page for their favorite book, TV show, artist, movie etc. Coders will use CSS to make sure that their pages are designed creatively. |
| [**3: RockPaperScissors**](units/unit3.md) | In this unit, coders will create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The Rock, Paper, Scissors game will take user choice, generate a computer choice, and display the winner to the screen. To create this project, coders will use jQuery to take user input and display data, the Math Library to generate a random choice, and conditionals to determine the winner. |
| [**Skills Day 1**](units/skillsdays/skillsday1.md) | On Professional Skills days, coders will demonstrate their technical and professional skills progress, update their portfolios, and participate in a team building activity.  This is a great opportunity to invite other people from your company to see what students have been working on and help guide them through whiteboarding exercises. |
| [**4: Buzzfeed Quiz**](units/unit4.md) | In this unit, coders will use JavaScript functions to build a BuzzFeed style webapp that will determine at which tech company the user will placed. |
| [**5: Playlist**](units/unit5.md) | In this unit, coders will create a Playlist. The Playlist will display a list of information about different songs with images and links to play the songs. To create this project, coders will create arrays, use a forEach loop to iterate over the arrays, and display data to the screen using jQuery. They will use .push to add new songs to their playlist. |
| [**Skills Day 2**](units/skillsdays/skillsday2.md) | On Professional Skills days, coders will demonstrate their technical and professional skills progress, update their portfolios, and participate in a team building activity.  This is a great opportunity to invite other people from your company to see what students have been working on and help guide them through whiteboarding exercises. |
| [**Mid-Year Unit**](units/midyear.md) | In this unit, coders will be introduced to the HackerRank platform, review concepts taught until this point and take a HackerRank Challenge to demonstrate their current technical ability. Coders will also complete a mid-year survey during this session. |
| [**6: ChooseYourOwnAdventure**](units/unit6.md) | In this unit, coders are introduced to objects through Popcode exercises, and a Jeopardy game. They are introduced to the unit project on Day 2. After the introduction, they will spend time planning their project and then spend the rest of their time completing it. |
| [**7: Giphy**](units/unit7.md) | In this unit, coders will create a Giphy App. The Giphy App will take a search term as an input and display a random Gif in a thumbnail on the screen. To create this project, coders will learn the anatomy of an API Request, use AJAX to make a simple GET request, handle a JSON response object, use jQuery to display a gif. |
| [**Skills Day 3**](units/skillsdays/skillsday3.md) | On Professional Skills days, coders will demonstrate their technical and professional skills progress, update their portfolios, and participate in a team building activity.  This is a great opportunity to invite other people from your company to see what students have been working on and help guide them through whiteboarding exercises. |
| [**8: ClientProject**](units/unit8.md) | In this unit, coders will work in pairs to build a project for a client based on a given set of APIs. This is a culminating project that incorporates all of the skills that have been taught in the course and is intended to highlight some important aspects of goal setting and project management. |
