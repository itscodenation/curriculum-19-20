# Skills Day 1:

## Overview

On Professional Skills days, coders will demonstrate their technical and professional skills progress, update their portfolios, and participate in a team building activity. This is a great opportunity to invite other people from your company to see what students have been working on and help guide them through whiteboarding exercises.
